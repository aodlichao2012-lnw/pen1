Just use a card such as a smart card, magnetic stripe, bar code, scan the code and pick up the borrowed book and place it on the borrower's stand. By providing a book borrowing service for 1-30 books at a time, then the printer will print the borrowing confirmation. automatically The said loan will indicate the name of the book, date and time of borrowing. and the date of return of the book
At the same time, when members take books out of the library Must pass through the electronic sensor door that acts as a guard at the entrance-exit of the library to check whether the book has been borrowed properly or not. If members accidentally take out the book without borrowing or stealing books will result in a signal light installed in the door flashing area and there is a warning signal to the members and librarian Even if the book is kept in the bag or hidden
Returning books is quick and easy. Members can bring books back to the library at the book return kit box. by simply placing the book on the installed code reader When the machine reads the code book from the radio frequency circuit board.

The main device of the intelligent library system is a radio frequency circuit board. It is the heart of the library. because it acts as a receiver and stores the code The book represents a barcode without showing the bar code. It is a paper thin circuit board measuring 2X2 inches.
